# In-Class Activity: Intro to Web Dev

This repository is your starting point for this in-class assignment. 

Link to your GitHub pages website: `https://github.com/DS4200-Fall21-Sec02/ic-03-intro-to-web-dev-wyeth-t.git`

# Aim of the assignment
Build comfort with how to use git, GitHub Pages, JS, HTML, and D3. 

# Instructions 
1. Edit near the top of this `README.md` file to include a clickable hyperlink to the GitHub page website for your repo., replacing the `` `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]` `` code with your markdown. (Detailed instructions for GitHub pages [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Using_Github_pages).) Note: you will need to make your repository public for pages to work. 

1. Navigate to the [HTML Page on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). On the left-hand side of the page there is a menu bar. Go through the following portions of the HTML tutorial: 
   - HTML Introduction
   - HTML Basic
   - HTML Elements
   - HTML Attributes
   - HTML CSS

1. Open the included index.html file in a text editor. Please do the following:
   - Add this title to your webpage "ic-03". 
   - Add a heading that says "Intro to Web Dev"
   - Add a sub-heading with your name.
   - Add a div, within that div put a screen shot of your favorite visualization. 
   - Add an *external* CSS stylesheet. 
   - Using your CSS stylesheet:
     - Set the font on your webpage to Arial. 
     - Center "Intro to Web Dev" and your name. 
     - Un-bold your name. 
     - Add a thick blue border to your visualization screenshot.
     - Give the div that holds your screenshot a width equal to half the page. Make sure your screenshot stays within your div (there shouldn't be overhang). 
     - Center the div that contains your screenshot.  

1. Navigate to the [JavaScript Page on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). On the left-hand side of the page there is a menu bar. Go through the following portions of the Javascript tutorial. 
   - JS Introduction
   - JS Where To
   - JS Output
   - JS Statements
   - JS Syntax
   - JS Vaiables
   - JS Let
   - JS Const

1. Open the included index.html and index.js files in a text editor (make sure you open index.js, *not* d3.js). Please do the following:
   - Modify your HTML file so that the index.js file is included in your webpage. 
   - Add a button to your webpage that says "Bold Title". Add functionality such that when the button is clicked "Intro to Web Dev" either gets bolded if it is un-bold, or un-bolds if it is bolded. The function you write should go in the index.js file.  


1. Navigate to this [D3 Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/d3js/index.htm). On the left-hand side of the page there is a menu bar. Go through the following portions of the D3 tutorial. 
   - Introduction
   - Installation
   - Concepts
   - Selections
   - Data Join
   - Introduction to SVG
   - SVG Transformation
   - Drawing Charts 

1. Open the included index.html and index.js files in a text editor. Please do the following:
   - Modify your HTML file so that the d3.js file is included (this will allow you to use the d3 library). **Note: you should not modify the d3.js file provided to you for any reason.** 
   - At the bottom of your web page, add a bar chart the shows the data in data.csv. Create your bar chart using D3.
     - For now, hardcode the data in data.csv into your script, as is done in the "Drawing Charts" part of the tutorial, instead of reading from the data.csv file. 
     - If you have additional time in class, modify your script so that you read data from data.csv, so that the bars on your chart stretch across the x-axis instead of the y-axis, and so that your chart has axis labels and titles. You will likely need to look up additional sources to do this. That's okay and expected, please just **be sure to cite your sources** and make sure you understand the code you build off of so that you can modify it as needed. 

# Submission: 

1. Commit all your local code and push it to your remote GitHub Classroom-generated repository.

1. Create a PDF that contains the URL of your **GitHub Classroom-generated repository** and **submit it on gradescope via ic-03**. Do not submit a link to a personal repository; your repo must be within our class GitHub organization.
